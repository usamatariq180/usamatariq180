As a Full Stack Developer and Team Lead at Reactive Space, I specialize in building scalable, real-time AI applications that redefine user experiences. I lead a cross-functional team, ensuring the seamless integration of AI-driven solutions from backend systems to frontend interfaces. My technical expertise spans accross a wide range of technologies, with a strong focus on AI, cloud architecture, and web development.

I played a pivotal role in the development of VABOT, an avatar-based chatbot for kiosk systems, which raised $4.25M in seed funding. This project exemplifies my ability to merge innovation with business impact while leading high-performing teams.

I am passionate about pushing technological boundaries, driving project success through Agile methodologies, and continuously refining development processes for maximum efficiency.
